Phen2Disease: A Phenotype-driven Semantic Similarity-based Integrated Model for Disease and Gene Prioritization

# Precessing

Extract data/diseaselist.rar file to the current folder

Extract data/matrix/lin_similarity_matrix.json.gz file to the current folder

Place the patient HPO files under data/patient

Turn to src/model/Phen2Disease folder and run:

(1) Phen2Disease-patient.py, Phen2Disease-double.py, (Phen2Disease-disease.py (Can be run optionally))

(2) Get the disease sorting results of each case in the corresponding folder of src/result/diseaserank folder

# Disease Prioritization

(1) Turn to src/model/Similarityscore/disease_integrated folder in order to run:

score2disease_patient.py, score2disease_double.py , (score2disease_disease.py (Can be run optionally))

In src/result/diseaserank/result folder you can get the json file of diseases prioritization files after merging cases

(2) Run disease_integrated.py

Turn to src/utils/DiseaseRankResult/finally folder you can get the final file of the integrated of disease ranking results

# Gene Prioritization

(1) Turn to src/model/Similarityscore/gene_integrated folder in order to run:

score2disease_patient.py, score2disease_double.py , (score2disease_disease.py (Can be run optionally))

In src/result/diseaserank/result folder you can get the json file of diseases prioritization files after merging cases

(2) Run gene_integrated.py

Turn to src/utils/GeneRankResult/finally folder you can get the final file of the integrated of gene ranking results
