# Phen2Disease

Phen2Disease: A Phenotype-driven Semantic Similarity-based Integrated Model for Disease and Gene Prioritization

Please follow the following steps to run the three examples provided in the date/patient folder (or Place your patient HPO files into the folder data/patient folder). 


# PreProcessing

Extract the data/diseaselist.rar file to a current folder where you choose

Extract the data/matrix/lin_similarity_matrix.json.gz file to your chosen current folder

Go to the src/model/Phen2Disease folder:

(1) run Phen2Disease-patient.py, and Phen2Disease-double.py, (Phen2Disease-disease.py can be run optionally)

(2) retrieve the disease sorting results of each case from the corresponding folder of src/result/diseaserank 


# Disease Prioritization

(1) Go to the folder of src/model/Similarityscore/disease_integrated folder and run:

score2disease_patient.py, and score2disease_double.py, (score2disease_disease.py can be run optionally)

In the src/result/diseaserank/result folder, and you can get the json file of diseases prioritization files after merging cases.

(2) Run disease_integrated.py

Go to the src/utils/DiseaseRankResult folder, and you can get final files of the integrated disease ranking results.


# Gene Prioritization

(1) Go to the src/model/Similarityscore/gene_integrated folder and run:

score2disease_patient.py, and score2disease_double.py, (score2disease_disease.py can be run optionally))

In the src/result/diseaserank/result folder, you can get the json file of diseases prioritization files after merging cases.

(2) Run gene_integrated.py

Go to the src/utils/GeneRankResult folder, and you can get final files of the integrated gene ranking results.
